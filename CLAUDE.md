## Repository Overview

This repository, named "Exp_Graphiti_MemR3_AIRP_Intergration", is intended to contain documentation and possibly code related to integrating Graphiti and Neo4j, as well as other related technologies like MemR3 and AIRP.

## Codebase Architecture

There is currently no source code in this repository. It is expected to be documentation-focused, with potential future code implementation related to Graphiti and Neo4j integration.
